					<h2>A little bit about me</h2>

					<div class="half-width">
						<p>I've made my home base in Decatur, Georgia. My journey into tech started with a degree in philosophy. From there, I went on to massage therapy school and practiced for over a decade. Several side-gigs later, I finally landed in the design world. I found myself at a crossroads. Fish or cut bait. I decided to devote myself to design full-time. Massage therapy would always be there, but design was the direction that I wanted to currently explore. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="half-width">
						<p>I've primarily done visual design, but a year or so ago, I decided that I wanted to move into UX. I started learning more about that, but it became apparent that knowing how to code would help me in that journey. I finally bit the bullet and decided to take my admiration of developers into learning how to do it myself. So here I am and here is how I can help you...</p>
